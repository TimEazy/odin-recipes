    <h1>Cheap as Chilli!</h1>
    <img src="../images/chilli.jpeg" alt="A lovely bowl of chilli">
    <h2>Cheap in price but not in flavour!</h2>
    <p>This is my go to Sunday meal when I need something that is easy to cook that can last me a few days. Light on the wallet but heavy in flavour, this dish also comes stacked with protein from multiple sources. It's also super easy to hide plenty of vegetables that the kids won't notice!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>1 Brown Onion</li>
      <li>1 Large Carrot</li>
      <li>1 Large stalk of Celery</li>
      <li>Plenty of Garlic and Chilli paste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons of Chilli seasoning</li>
      <li>1/2 Cup of stock (beef or vege)</li>
      <li>Tin of tomatos</li>
      <li>400grm Beef Mince</li>
      <li>Tin of Lentils</li>
      <li>Tin of Red Kidney Beans</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>On a high heat - Brown the mince and then remove it from the pan</li>
       <li>Create a mirepoix with the onion, carrot and celery and saute for 10 minutes</li>
       <li>Add the Garlic and Chilli paste and the chilli seasoning. Let the spices bloom for 5 minutes</li>
       <li>Add the stock, tomatos and beefmince back to the pot. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 30 minutes</li>
       <li>Add the drained and washed Lentils - Repeat for the Kidney beans</li>
       <li>Let the pot simmer for atleast an hour. Though you can simmer this for as long as you'd like (<em>the longer the better</em>)</li>
     </ol>
     <p>The dish is complete! Serve this with wraps or with rice. Add a large dollop of sour cream and grated cheese on top. <strong>Delish!</strong></p>
