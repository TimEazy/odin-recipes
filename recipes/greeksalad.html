    <h1>Fresh from the garden Greek Salad</h1>
    <img src="../images/greeksalad.jpeg" alt="A bountiful bowl of greek salad!">
    <h2>A super fresh recipe that is a staple in the mediterranean diet</h2>
    <p>This dish is a summer classic because that's the time of the year that most of these vegetables are sold cheap. Cut everything quite large and rough and don't buy cheap oil or feta</p>
    <h2 class="sub">Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>1 green capsicum</li>
      <li>Punnet of cherry tomatos</li>
      <li>Half a red onion</li>
      <li>A handful of kalamata olives</li>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Half a block of feta</li>
      <li>Red wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of decent olive oil</li>
     </ul>
    <h2 class="sub">Method</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>Cut all the vegetables large and rough and mix together in a bowl</li>
       <li>Add the olive oil and a splash of red wine vinegar and incorporate</li>
       <li>Add the feta and top with some fresh italian parsley</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Serve a big bowl as it's own dish or serve it as a side with some grilled lamb. This dish is simple but delicious.</p>
