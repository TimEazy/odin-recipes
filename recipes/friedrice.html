    <h2>Super-quick weekly meal that's easy on the stomach</h2>
    <p>I normally make this dish every time I cook a different rice dish as it's best made with day old rice. It's easy because most people already have the majority of the ingredients needed for this just laying around!</p>
    <h2 class="sub">Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>1/2 Brown Onion finely diced</li>
      <li>1 cup of frozen mixed vege</li>
      <li>2 cups of day-old rice</li>
      <li>Plenty of Garlic and Chilli paste</li>
      <li>Soya Sauce</li>
      <li>Protein of choice</li>
     </ul>
    <h2 class="sub">Method</h2>
     <ol>
       <li>On a high heat in a large frying pan add the onion and frozen veges</li>
       <li>Saute these until they get a nice colour</li>
       <li>Add the Garlic and Chilli paste, the soya sauce and the day old rice</li>
       <li>Once these are all incorporated add your protein of choice</li>
       <li>Serve hot!</li>

     </ol>
     <p>Dinner is served! See why it's called super-quick? Obviously this recipe is a god send as it's easy to customize with any ingredients you have on hand. Feel free to reach out on my socials and tell me what you added that stepped this dish up to the next level.</p>
